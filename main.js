  Challenges: 
  
  Instructions: Use the array methods you just learned to solve 
  the following challenges. In each array, the employees should be
  listed in order of rank, from highest to lowest. 
  
  1.  I forgot to add {name: "Michelle", score: 98} and 
      {name: "Zeke", score: 90} to the topTierEmployees array! 
      Please add them to the array in the appropriate spots. 
      This should take you two steps. 
  
  2.  I also forgot to add {name: "Allen", score: 75} and 
      {name: "Alison", score: 74} to the midTierEmployees array.
      Please add them! This should take you only one step.
  
  3.  I also forgot to add {name: "Emma", score: 36} and 
      {name: "David", score: 32} to the bottomTierEmployees array. 
      Please add them! This should take you only one step.
  
  4.  I need an array of all the employees to send to HR. 
      Please combine the three arrays of the three tiers of 
      employees into a new array called "allEmployees", 
      preserving the order in terms of ranking from highest to 
      lowest. This should take you only one step.
  
  5.  I need another new array of employees to fire, called 
      employeesToFire. Here at Big Corporation Inc., we only want 
      top-tier employees, so please add the mid-tier and bottom-tier 
      employees to it, once again preserving the order of scores 
      from highest to lowest. This should take you only one step.
  
  6.  Create a copy of employeesToFire called "secretFiringList", 
      and add John to it. John is a good employee, but I don't like 
      him, so I want to fire him too â€” but I want to keep this 
      secret from my company's HR department until the last moment.
